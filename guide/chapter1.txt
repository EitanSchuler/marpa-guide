What is Marpa?
--------------

Marpa is parser library written in Perl and C. It gives you a way to convert
text to a structure based on any BNF. During the parsing Marpa knows what
tokens it expects next and allows you to guide the parse in the right
direction.

Getting the code
----------------

Marpa is a Perl library. We will use
[Marpa::R2](http://metacpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2) for the examples in this guide.

If you have Perl already installed you can install Marpa with `cpan` or `cpanm`.

    $ cpan Marpa::R2

or

    $ cpanm Marpa::R2

This will install Marpa::R2.

In the rest of this guide we'll assume you have installed Marpa::R2. The examples
that end in '.pl' can be executed using `perl`.
