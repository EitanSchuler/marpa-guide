Chapter 1 - Getting Started
===========================

!include "guide/menu.inc"

Getting the code
----------------

Marpa is a Perl library. We will use
[Marpa::R2](http://metacpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2) for the examples in this guide.

If you have Perl already installed you can install Marpa with `cpan` or `cpanm`.

    $ cpan Marpa::R2

or

    $ cpanm Marpa::R2

This will install Marpa::R2.

First example
-------------

Let's start with an example. What follows is the smallest code that could parse
a number.

!include "examples/number.pl"

In this example we parse a number using the `\d` character class. The character
classes used by Marpa are the same as those used by Perl.

You can run the code by calling it with `perl`.

    $ perl number.pl 9999
    Trying to parse:
    9999
    ok

In the next we move on by just using the special notation used by Marpa.

!include "examples/number.sbnf"

Marpa uses the `:start` rule to specify which rule should be matched first. The
declaration `::=` operator separates the left side from the right side.

The left side is the name of the rule. The right side specifies what it matches to.


The next example shows how easy it to improve that grammar to parse multiple
numbers separated by whitespace.

!include "examples/numbers.sbnf"
